# SPLiT-seq DGE matrix generation
**work in progress**

## Why this repo?
This repository provides tools to integrate raw scRNA-seq data (fastq files) that have been generated by a SPLiT-seq experiment. The two pipelines being developed will allow the calculation of a digital gene expression (DGE) matrix from raw SPLiT-seq data. Only the .fastq files (paired-end sequencing) and few other files (metadata) are necessary to obtain a DGE matrix. The two pipelines being developed utilize the aligners [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) and [Bowtie2](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR), and functions from [Drop-seq tools](https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq/releases) and [picard-tools](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). All other functionalities are implemented in python and can be executed in bash scripts with parameters specifying input (.fastq files, reference genome, etc.) and other options (alignment depth, output file names etc.).
## The SPLiT-seq experiment
The scRNA-seq technology SPLiT-seq was originally published by Rosenberg et al. (["Single-cell profiling of the developing mouse brain and spinal cord with split-pool barcoding"](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/176)) in 2018.

RNA transcripts of cells are labeled with cell specific barcodes (cellular barcodes = CBCs) and a uniquq molecular identifier (UMI). The CBCs make it possible to assign RNA transcripts to cells, whereas the UMI allows to distinugish technical from biological replicates.

## Workflow
```
- create file containing barcodes used in SPLiT-seq experiment
- create all possible combinations of barcodes (BCs)
- filter mate reads
  - align BC reads to BC combinations
  - select BC reads with ED < 2 in BC region and UMIs with Phred32 > 10
  - select the corresponding mate reads in Genomic reads .fastq file
  - write selected BC reads, UMIs and genomics reads to .fastq files (BC_filtered.fastq and Genomic_filtered.fastq)
  ```
